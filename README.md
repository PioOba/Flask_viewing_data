## **Overview**
In this project we use Flask and Flask-SQLALchemy library to present data about electric car chargers that I have found on data.europa.eu (full source link at the bottom of the description). Apart from simply viewing the table we can also filtr it by the date.
## **Instructions**
To run this application you'll need SQLite installed, as the database in this project uses it.
Simply run the app.py and the site will be hosted on localhost. You will only need to write localhost:5000 in your browser to access it.

To filtr by the date enter the starting and ending date and press "Filtr" button.
## **Tools**
##Python 3.8
##Flask 2.0.2
##Flask-SQLAlchemy 2.5.1
